The Small2 model is the best I would say of the 3 Small classes

It has 3.7+ million parameters and has got all the images correct, same could be said for Small1 but Small2 was more sure of the anwsers.

It took 0.44 seconds to run which is about the same as its peers except for Small3 which took only 0.33 seconds to run however that model got one wrong.
